Updated for API version [1.12] for TShock ver. 3.9.

Bugs fixed:
    Spamming of player upon entry of any quest region defined after the first.
    Fixed a bug in TakeItem().
    Fixed a bug in GetXYWallPercentage().
    Fixed a bug in WallEdit().
    When a player leaves their open quest threads and quests will now close properly, to prevent memory leaks. (I think.)
    Probably more that I can't remember.


Functions Added:
GetTile(int x, int y) : returns TileData2
    Get's a TileData2 object which contains all of a tile's data.
    Credit to Olink for the basic idea for the struct. It came from his Schematics plugin source.

SetTile(int x, int y, TileData2 data)
    Sets the specified tile to have the data provided.

CheckEmpty(int x, int y) : returns bool
    Returns true the specified tile has neither a tile nor a wall on it. Otherwise returns false.

BuffPlayer(string buffname, QPlayer Player, int time) : returns bool
    Buffs the specified player using standard buff name lookup for [time] seconds.
    returns true if successful, returns false if more than one buff was found.

CheckDay() : returns bool
    Returns true if it is daytime.

CheckTime(double time, int range, bool dayTime = true) : returns bool
    Checks the game time for any time withing [range] of [time].
        Example: CheckTime(27000, 10000, true);
    This will return true if the time is anywhere between 17000 and 37000 and Main.dayTime == true.
    If dayTime = true then this will apply to Main.dayTime == true, if false then it will apply Main.dayTime == false.

HealPlayer(QPlayer Player)
    Heals the specified player.
    This comes almost directly out of the TShockAPI source. Thanks to the team behind TShock.
