Version 2.2 (Current and ongoing) (API 1.13 Only currently. Will port to 1.12 if I finish this version before TShock 4.1 releases.)
* Fixed bug in GiveUpItem which causes one player's drops to count for another's.
* WIP: /progress command. Displays a menu showing your current progress in a quest.
* Untested: Changed GatherItem trigger to allow for concurrent objectives like HuntMob and GiveUpItem.

Version 2.1.1
