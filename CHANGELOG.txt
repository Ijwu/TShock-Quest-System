* Fixed bug in GiveUpItem which causes one player's drops to count for another's.
* WIP: /progress command. Displays a menu showing your current progress in a quest.
* Untested: Changed GatherItem trigger to allow for concurrent objectives like HuntMob and GiveUpItem.
* Switched to NLua as lua interface between lua and .NET.
