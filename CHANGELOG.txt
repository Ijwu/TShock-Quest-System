Version 2.2 (Current and ongoing) (API 1.13 Only currently. Will port to 1.12 if I finish this version before TShock 4.1 releases.)
* Fixed bug in GiveUpItem which causes one player's drops to count for another's.
* /progress command. Displays a menu showing your current progress in a quest.
* Untested: Changed GatherItem trigger to allow for concurrent objectives like HuntMob and GiveUpItem.
* Switched to NLua for a bridge between lua and .NET.
	* No longer using LuaInterface and now requires some new DLLs to be placed in certain directories. Old ones may be discarded.
* Both versions: Added Quest Region a quest is started in to the scope of the quest.
	* Under global variable named "Region"
* Parameters for TileEdit and WallEdit triggers have been rearranged in order to keep the system consistent.
	* New Parameter Order: string name, int x, int y
* New Parameters for ReadNextChatLine: QPlayer player
	* The hide message parameter has been removed.

Known Bugs/Issues:
* Berserker's quest crashes the server, somehow.
* Players can crash the server by logging in. What a bunch of assholes. Maybe?
